A very small (DLL size is only 3KB) JNI library for in-memory loading of native code. Everything here can already be done with [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna), so this library is only useful when JNA is not available (e.g. Minecraft 1.7.10 and dedicated server of Minecraft 1.12.2)

Built for x64 Windows, x64/ARM64 Linux and x64/ARM64 MacOS.
